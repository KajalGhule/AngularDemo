ng generate module custom

ng generate module shared

ng generate component shared/conditional


ng generate module custom → creates a reusable logical boundary.
ng generate module shared → creates a shared space for common directives, pipes, and components.
ng generate component shared/conditional → creates a new component inside shared.
Declare and export it in the module → makes it available across the app.

 under @NgModule, you see three important sections: imports, declarations, and exports.

@NgModule({
  declarations: [ConditionalComponent],
  imports: [CommonModule],
  exports: [ConditionalComponent]
})
export class SharedModule { }


----------------------------------------

I walked to the whiteboard and drew two columns.

Structural Directives (with *)	Attribute Directives (no *)
*ngIf	[ngStyle]
*ngFor	[ngClass]
*ngSwitchCase	appHighlight (custom)
“Now, look carefully,” I said. “Some directives begin with a star (★) — like *ngIf or *ngFor. That star means Angular will add or remove elements from the DOM — these are called Structural Directives.

Others, like [ngSwitch] or [ngClass], don’t change the DOM structure — they just change the appearance or behavior of existing elements. Those are Attribute Directives.”


--------------------------------------------

So when you write something like this:”

<div *ngIf="isFlowerAvailable()">Welcome to Transflower</div>
“You’re not just checking a condition. You’re declaring what to do when that condition is true or false — that’s called declarative programming.

---------------------

*“A component is like a brain — it holds thought (logic) and memory (data). A template is like a face — it shows what the brain thinks. And directives are expressions on that face — showing emotions depending on conditions.”*

---------------

Structural Directives are like construction workers — they can build new rooms, remove walls, or decide which rooms are visible.
Attribute Directives, on the other hand, are like painters and decorators — they don’t change the structure of your house, but they modify its look or behavior.

-----------------------
structural directives

examples are:

*ngIf
*ngFor
*ngSwitchCase
*ngSwitchDefault
---------------------------------

Attribute directives

Some examples:

ngModel
ngStyle
ngClass
ngTemplate
hidden
