Round brackets (click) → Event binding (child triggers action).
Square brackets [count] → Property binding (parent passes data to child).
@Input() decorator → Declares that a property can receive value from parent.
Public vs Private → Public is needed if Angular template must access it.
TypeScript types → Keep everything safe. count: number prevents string assignment errors.


<app-counter [count]="likes" (increment)="onLikesIncrement($event)"></app-counter>


| Part                                     | Code           | Meaning                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `[count]="likes"`                        | Parent → Child | Send likes value to child display   |
| `(increment)="onLikesIncrement($event)"` | Child → Parent | Receive increment signal from child |



Parent (ProductComponent)
     likes = 5
         ↓ [count]
Child (CounterComponent) displays 5
         ↑ (increment emits 1)
Parent updates likes = 6



Child: onLike() button clicked!
Child → emit(1)
               ↓
Parent receives event → onLikesIncrement(1)
Parent updates likes value


*ngFor act like our for loop
