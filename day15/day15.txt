Observer Pattern — The Heart of RxJS

Imagine I (the mentor) am the “Subject / Observable”. You — the students — are the Observers.


One event → multiple listeners → multiple reactions

That, my friends, is the Observer Pattern.



A Subject is both:

An Observable (it can broadcast)
An Observer (it can listen to other observables)


BehaviorSubject -> It always holds the most recent value.

The Campus Life of RxJS Operators
1. map() — The Transformer -> Transforms input into something new.
example :: If input is marks: 50 map(x => x + 10) transforms it to 60.
source$
  .pipe(map(x => x * 2))
  .subscribe(console.log);

2. filter() — The Security Guard
Allow only specific people to pass.
source$
  .pipe(filter(score => score > 80))
  .subscribe(console.log);

3. debounceTime() — The Smart Listener
Ignore fast repeated inputs and respond only when things settle down.

debounceTime(300ms) waits until user stops typing for 300ms and then fires only once.

In code:

input$
  .pipe(debounceTime(300))
  .subscribe(search);

4. merge() — The Friendly Combiner
Combine multiple streams and send them out together.”
merge(click$, shortcut$, voice$)
  .subscribe(doAction);


5. switchMap() — The Campus Topper
 Whenever a new request comes, cancel the previous one and switch to the latest.


6. combineLatest() — Group Study
Whenever ANY of you updates your notes, the group gets the latest combo.

7. takeUntil() — The Class Bell
 Once the bell rings, all subscriptions stop automatically.
