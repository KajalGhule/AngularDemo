Key Learning Points for Students
Use *ngFor="let item of items" for structural iteration.
Apply *ngFor on container elements (e.g., <div> or <tr>).
Use @Input() properties for parent-to-child data communication.
Handle nullable values safely in TypeScript.
Modularize UI components like Cart and CartItem for reusability.
Always practice while learning — that’s where real understanding develops.
Maintain your GitHub repository actively for mentor feedback and collaboration.
